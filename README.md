## Description
Level 1 is set as one map, a player who cannot grow.

 Every time you clear the jump map. By selecting and applying one of the penalties such as speed increase, viewing angle decrease, gravity increase, etc., the main purpose of the game is to make it difficult by increasing the difficulty of the same jump map.

 The intention was to raise the difficulty level without touching the variable called the jump map, so it was a game that made you feel a little disconnected, but it may have been conveyed well.
